Welcome to the inaugural Journal Picks 2.0.  The Journal Annotation team have been scouring the literature looking for papers that will be of interest to people on campus.

It is easy to get involved, and can be as little or as much work as you want to do. If you read journal table of contents regularly then it only takes a couple of clicks to add interesting new articles to Journal picks.

You need to create a CiteULike account (www.citeulike.org) and then let Frances (fsm@sanger.ac.uk) know your username so we can invite you to join the group.  Then simply add papers that you think are interesting.

If you have any questions, please email journal_picks@sanger.ac.uk.
Happy Reading!
The Journal Annotation Team
