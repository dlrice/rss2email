<p>Welcome to the inaugural Journal Picks 2.0.  The Journal Annotation team have been scouring the literature looking for papers that will be of interest to people on campus.</p>
<p>It is easy to get involved, and can be as little or as much work as you want to do. If you read journal table of contents regularly then it only takes a couple of clicks to add interesting new articles to Journal picks.</p>
<p>You need to create a <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike account</a> and then let <a href="mailto:fsm@sanger.ac.uk">Frances</a> know your username so we can invite you to join the group.  Then simply add papers that you think are interesting.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:journal_picks@sanger.ac.uk">journal_picks@sanger.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Reading!<br>The Journal Annotation Team</p>
